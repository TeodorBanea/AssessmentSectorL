# AssessmentSectorLabs

This project was made with the python unit testing library and Selenium.

The "main.py" file contains the code for the our 2 tests:
The first test asserts that each property resulted in the search page matches the location that is in the searchbox.
The second test asserts each suggested link is properly loaded(the purpose is set to "Rent" and the location
matches the location in the link).


In the "locators.py" file are stored all the selectors used in our tests for the Bayut website.
